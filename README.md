## Usage Guide

### Ticker Selection
Enter a valid stock ticker symbol (e.g., SPY, TSLA, AAPL, NDX, SPX) in the input field. The application supports both standard equity tickers and index tickers.

### Expiry Date Selection
Choose an expiration date from the dropdown menu. The available dates are fetched dynamically based on the selected ticker.

### Strike Range Adjustment
Use the slider to adjust the range of strike prices displayed in the visualization. This allows for focusing on strikes closest to the current price or viewing a wider range of strikes.

### Interpreting the Visualizations

#### Options Volume Heatmap
- **Color intensity**: Higher intensity indicates larger volume at that strike price
- **Current price line**: Red dashed line showing the current price of the underlying asset
- **Expected range**: Shaded area showing the statistically expected trading range based on volume distribution
- **Market sentiment**: Displayed at the top with color coding (green for bullish, red for bearish, orange for neutral)
- **Call/Put ratio**: The ratio between call and put volumes, with higher values indicating bullish sentiment

#### Directional Bias Meter
- **Horizontal meter**: Visualizes the directional bias from bearish (left) to bullish (right)
- **Directional score**: Quantifies the strength of the directional bias from 0-100
- **Market view**: Interpretation of how market participants are positioning (speculative, protective, volatile, or balanced)
- **Capital bias**: Analysis of where capital is being allocated (calls vs puts)
- **Call/Put skew**: Analysis of whether volume is concentrated in OTM or ITM options

#### Delta-Adjusted Open Interest Chart
- **Green bars (above)**: Call delta-adjusted open interest
- **Magenta bars (below)**: Put delta-adjusted open interest
- **Current price line**: Blue dashed line showing the current price
- **Option walls**: Significant concentrations of delta-adjusted open interest that may act as support/resistance
- **DAOI ratio**: The ratio between call and put delta-adjusted open interest, with interpretation

## Advanced Features

### Delta-Adjusted Open Interest (DAOI)
DAOI weights the open interest by the option's delta, providing a more accurate representation of potential hedging pressure on the underlying asset. This calculation helps identify significant levels where market makers may need to hedge their positions, potentially influencing price action.

### Directional Bias Calculation
The directional bias is calculated by considering:
- The distribution of volume between calls and puts
- The skew between ITM and OTM options
- The concentration of volume at specific strikes relative to the current price
- The premium allocation between calls and puts

### Expected Range Calculation
The expected trading range is determined by:
- Calculating the volume-weighted average of all strike prices
- Determining the standard deviation of volume distribution
- Setting the range as the average Â± one standard deviation
- Color-coding based on the width of the range (tighter ranges in green, wider ranges in red)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No data available**: Ensure the ticker symbol is valid and has options trading available
- **Empty visualizations**: Check if the selected expiration date has sufficient trading volume
- **Error fetching options**: Network issues may occur when fetching data from Yahoo Finance; try again later
- **Missing Greeks data**: Some options data may be missing Greeks information; the application will estimate values

### Performance Optimization
- The application uses caching to improve performance when fetching options data
- For tickers with many strike prices, adjust the strike range slider to focus on relevant prices
- Data is refreshed automatically when changing tickers or expiration dates
